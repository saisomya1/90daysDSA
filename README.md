DAY-01
**
**
**Start the TIME and SPACE complexity . Undarstand that how both are work and why it use in our code .
  Doing some problems in GEEKSFORGEEKS easy and medium problems (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-time-complexity-analysis/). 
  
  
  DAY-02
  **
  **
  **Today i should learn the core of the time and space complexity and solve some problem . After that i should revise the yester day work.
  End of the day i will revise the all program and problem in my memory and the today practice link is(https://medium.com/@manishsundriyal/overview-time-space-complexity-f973513b701e). I think my doubt will clear in time and space complexity. Finally i will start (recursion and backtracking) from tomorow ..
